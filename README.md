# NodeJs App with API

#### Make sure you have nodemon, express and node installed

###### Background info
The project here uses the socket.io api. This api is a websocket that allows you to send information from the browser 
to the server and vice versa without having to do lots of http requests.
Here I use this api to create a chat network between 2 users. If you want to try this download the code and open it on 2 browsers
and click on 'chat' which you can find on the navigation bar.

I also used the socket.io api for a feedback form that can be found on the navbar as well. Here the user can type up text information
and see it appear immediately

Because I felt really unfamiliar with ejs I first created a home and friends page before starting the api project. 
I hope to use this later on to create a fulling functioning feedback and chat app.
